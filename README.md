# shape-toy-prompt2

**Overview of the Implementation:**

**Design Decisions:**

1. **Custom Hooks:** The codebase utilizes custom React hooks to manage different aspects of the application. For example, the `useCanvas` hook is responsible for managing the canvas and its rendering context, and the `useShapes` hook handles the management of shapes on the canvas.

2. **Shape Editing:** The `ShapeEditor` component is designed to allow users to edit the properties of shapes. It offers functionality for changing properties such as shape type, color, and coordinates.

3. **Testing:** The codebase includes unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the functionality and behavior of components. These tests ensure that the application meets the expected requirements and continues to work as expected during development.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Custom Hooks:** Future developers should understand the concept of custom hooks and their use in managing complex state and functionality in React applications. The `useCanvas` and `useShapes` hooks encapsulate specific behaviors, promoting code modularity and reusability.

2. **Reducer Pattern:** The implementation follows the reducer pattern, which centralizes state management and actions for the application. Future programmers should grasp the benefits of using this pattern for maintainability and predictability in state changes.

**Response to Future Feature Requests:**

- **localStorage-based Persistence:** To support localStorage-based persistence, you can create functions that serialize the application's state and save it to localStorage. When the application loads, it can check for saved data in localStorage and use it to initialize the state. This would enable users to save their drawings across sessions.

- **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Implementing undo/redo functionality would require extending the reducer to maintain a history of state changes. Developers would need to store a sequence of actions and states and provide mechanisms to navigate backward and forward in this history. Undo and redo buttons could trigger these actions.

- **Save to Image:** To enable saving the canvas as an image, you'd need to add functionality for rendering the canvas content to an image format (e.g., PNG or JPEG). This can be done using the HTML5 Canvas API. Users would trigger a "Save as Image" action, and the current canvas content would be converted into an image file that they can download.

**Performance Bottlenecks:**

- **Large Number of Shapes:** If the application allows a large number of shapes on the canvas, rendering and updating all shapes can become a performance bottleneck. To address this, you can implement optimizations like rendering only the visible portion of the canvas and using techniques like virtualization.

- **Frequent State Changes:** Frequent state changes or re-renders can impact performance. Memoization techniques, such as React's `useMemo` and `useCallback`, can help prevent unnecessary re-renders. Additionally, for real-time collaborative features, consider WebSocket integration for efficient updates.
